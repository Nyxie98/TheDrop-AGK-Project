# TheDrop-AGK-Project
A basic game made with AGK. After 3 years of not doing anything with this project, I decided to share the project.

## About
This was a game I made for mobile, using AppGameKit. The project is written in Visual Basic exactly 3 years ago.
This should serve as a good introduciton into what can be done with AGK. You are free to use the code for any other project.

## How To Play
Getting this project should be simple. Just download the repository, and open the .agk file in [AppGameKit](https://www.appgamekit.com/order).
If you have the mobile app, you can then just click Broadbast, and run it from your mobile. Otherwise, you can click Run to play on your PC.

The game's controls on PC:
1. Arrow keys to move
2. Click buttons as an alternative to tapping

The game's controls on mobile:
1. Tilt phone to move
2. Tap buttons to navigate menus

Coins allow you to buy upgrades, diamonds widen the play area.
